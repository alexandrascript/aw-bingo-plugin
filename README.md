* Version 1.1
* This plugin is for implementing bingo cards on WordPress posts and custom post types.
+ Demo images are available in the folder `/demo`.

The Bingo Card Plugin generates randomized bingo cards for WordPress posts. It is supported on WordPress 4.0 and above. The plugin is powered by vanilla JavaScript and CSS, no additional libraries required.

**WARNING**: installing WordPress's <a href="https://jetpack.com">Jetpack plugin</a> has been known to cause errors. This plugin may have conflicts and not work as expected. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I have updated this code as recently as September 2019, but it may not be perfect. If there are problems or pitfalls, please do report them in a GitHub issue. However, I am not responsible for any problems this causes as it relates to your WordPress installation or server.

## Required assets

For each Bingo board you should have the following images:

* 24 or more bingo tiles uploaded directly to your post. These should be square images, either JPG or PNG. I recommend size 150px x 150px.
* 1 free space tile. This should be the same size as the bingo cards.
* 1 bingo header image, width 650px
* 3 winner images. Recommended size 500px x 300px

To use the demo, upload the images in `/demo/bingo-cards` directly to your WordPress post. The other images should be uploaded directly to the Media gallery.

## Instructions

1. Upload the Bingo Plugin on your WordPress installation.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Create a post and add the two shortcodes `[bingocard]` `[bingo_gallery]`
   + If using the Gutenberg editor, you must use a **Shortcode** block for each shortcode.
   + If using the Classic editor, add the two shortcodes with a line break in between them.
1. Upload at least 24 bingo tiles directly to your post. Images should be square.
   + If using the Gutenberg editor, add an image block and click the **Media Library** button.
   + If using the Classic editor, click the **Add Media** button above the WYSIWYG.
   + DO NOT upload the featured image, free space image, or winner images directly to the post. Any photo uploaded to the post will be in rotation on the bingo card.
   + DO NOT include the images in the body of the post. The images should be attached to the post without in the body content.

1. Upload the remaining images (free space, winner cards, featured post image, etc) directly to the **Media** library.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Bingo Card Settings**.
1. Select the name of the post for your bingo card to **Bingo Card 1 Post Name**.
1. Add the URL for the **Bingo Card 1 Header Image**.
1. Add the URL for the **Bingo Card 1 Free Space**.
1. Add up to three winner card image URLs to be used for social media sharing.
1. Save the settings.

Repeat these steps for up to three posts.
